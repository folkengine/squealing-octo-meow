Scratch Project for Music21

Based on: https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/datascience-notebook

Build and run the Docker image:

    $> cd docker
    $> docker build -t='music21' .
    $> docker run -d -p 8888:8888 music21 start-notebook.sh
    
Now you'll need to open up a web browser to the IP address where your docker is running. For me localhost:8888 doesn't work 
on OSX.
